<Tool Invocation:google_search/>
<Tool Input:{{'search_query': 'Transportation options from New York to Boston'}}/>

your output:
<Analysis:Now that we know the transportation options, let's find out about the main attractions in Boston./>

## Constraints
## 3. Travel Planning Guidelines

during the planning process, please remember:

1. Strict adherence to the user-specified budget constraints.
2. Fulfillment of the user's specific dining requirements and preferences.
3. Don't forget to include the return flight to the starting city on the last day. Since you won't be staying in a hotel on the last day, accommodation expenses are not calculated.
4. Accurate calculation of total costs:
   - One-time fees (such as attraction tickets) are only included once.
   - Daily recurring costs (like accommodation) are multiplied by the number of days.
5. Allocate reasonable time for each attraction, considering opening hours and required visit duration.
6. Take into account the travel time between different locations.
7. Include time and locations for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.
8. **Reduce breakfast expenses by skipping breakfast or opting for hotel breakfast.**
9. **Add ratings for restaurants, attractions, and hotels (if available in the information).**
10. Unless specified, do not provide a time range for visiting an attraction.
11. You don't need to mention "returning to the hotel" in the itinerary unless it's for check-in/out or to use hotel facilities (you can include activities like swimming or working out).
Please use these guidelines to create a comprehensive, detailed travel plan that meets the user's requirements.

PLAN_CHECKER_PROMPT = """You are a professional travel itinerary planner responsible for reviewing travel itineraries drafted by a third party, ensuring they meet user requirements and best practices for travel planning. Please review the itinerary for each day according to the following criteria:

1. **Time Allocation**: Review the feasibility of the itinerary for transportation, attractions, and restaurants, which encompasses two aspects:
    * The order of activities (sequence)
    * Reasonable allocation of time for morning, noon, and evening activities2. **Accommodation and Dining**: Ensure that accommodation and dining arrangements meet the user's budget and preferences.
3. **Special Requirements**: Confirm if the itinerary meets all of the user's special requirements (e.g., attraction preferences, budget constraints, etc.).
{extra_requirements}
Your task is to:
- Review the itinerary for each day and provide specific feedback.
- If the itinerary for a particular day does not meet the requirements, please explain in detail which parts do not comply and provide suggestions for modification.
- After reviewing all days, output based on the overall situation:
  - If all itineraries meet the requirements, output "No more suggestion".
  - If there are non-compliant areas, output <Advice:/> tag which contains a list of modification suggestions.

A well-planned trip should meet the following requirements:

1. The actual expenses should be as close to the budget as possible, but not exceed it.
2. A variety of attractions and restaurants should be included.
3. The time schedule should be reasonable.

Key considerations:

1. If the expenses are already close to the budget, there is no need to further reduce costs.
2. If the expenses are significantly lower than the budget, it is possible to add some attractions, restaurants, or upgrade the accommodation standard accordingly.
### Output Format:
