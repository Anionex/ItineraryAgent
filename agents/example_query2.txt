I'm planning a 5-day trip to Italy. I want to explore beautiful scenery, enjoy local cuisine, and visit some historical and cultural sites. I also want at least one day for relaxation. My budget is moderate, and I prefer a slow-paced itinerary.

Can you create a travel plan for me based on these preferences?
