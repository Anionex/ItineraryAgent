<Analysis:We have gathered information about dining options in Rockford. Some noteworthy choices are:

1. Coco Bambu
2. Flying Mango
3. Gajalee Sea Food
4. Shree Balaji Chaat Bhandar
5. Moets Arabica 

Now that we have all the necessary information about flights, accommodations, attractions, and dining options, let's outline the travel itinerary for the trip. I'd briefly break down the costs to ensure they fit within the allotted $1,700 budget./>
<Analysis:Based on the gathered data, we need to estimate the costs for flight, accommodations, dining, and attractions. Here is a brief breakdown:

1. **Flight**: $474
2. **Accommodations**: Prices not specified, but we will estimate using average costs.
3. **Dining**: Assume $50 per day for 3 days (Total: $150)
4. **Attractions**: Assume entry fees and other costs totaling $60-$100 over 3 days

Let's estimate the total average accommodation cost. We'll consider moderate pricing at around $100 per night (Total: 3 nights x $100 = $300).

Summarizing the cost estimates: 
- Flight: $474 
- Accommodations: $300 
- Dining: $150 
- Attractions: $100 
- Miscellaneous: $100

Total estimated cost: $474 + $300 + $150 + $100 + $100 = $1,124

We still have adequate budget space. Next, I'll proceed to create the detailed travel itinerary./>
