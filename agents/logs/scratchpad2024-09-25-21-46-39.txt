<Analysis:

We've found several accommodation options in Rockford with varying prices and review scores. Considering the budget constraints and the need for a balanced cost and rating, here are two potential options:

1. Private Room at $210 (review rate: 4.0)
2. Modern 1-bedroom apartment at $377 (review rate: 5.0)

The first option will help in maintaining a lower budget, while the second option offers more comfort and slightly higher reviews.

<Analysis:
To better align the budget, we'll choose "Nutri Punch," which is slightly less expensive with an average cost of $34 and a good rating of 4.0 for the lunch on Day 2. This adjustment helps in maintaining the overall budget balance.

Next, let's consider reallocating some of the remaining budget to enhance the travel experience. For this, we'll:
1. Upgrade accommodation to a slightly better option.
2. Possibly add another activity if the budget allows.
