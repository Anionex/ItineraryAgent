## Constraints
## 3. Travel Planning Guidelines

during the planning process, please remember:

1. Strict adherence to the user-specified budget constraints.
2. Fulfillment of the user's specific dining requirements and preferences.
3. 别忘了搜索返程机票，在最后一天返回起点城市.最后一天不住酒店，不计算酒店开销。
4. Accurate calculation of total costs:
   - Include one-time fees (such as attraction tickets) only once.
   - Multiply daily recurring costs (like accommodation) by the number of days.
5. Reasonable time allocation for each attraction, considering opening hours and required visit duration.
6. Consideration of travel time between different locations.
7. Inclusion of breakfast, lunch, and dinner times and locations.
8. **降低早餐费用、不吃早餐或者优先在酒店解决早餐**
9. **在餐厅/景点/酒店后附加评分（如果信息中有）。**
10. 除非限定，不要给出一个景点的参观时间区间。
11. 你无需特别在iternary中提到“回酒店”，除非是check in/out或者安排用户享受酒店的设施（可以适当加入，例如：游泳、健身）。

Please use these guidelines to create a comprehensive, detailed travel plan that meets the user's requirements.
