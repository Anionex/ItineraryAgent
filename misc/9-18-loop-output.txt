Checking result.
Check result: - Day 1: The itinerary meets the requirements. The total duration of activities is reasonable, and the transportation arrangements to the airport are appropriate. The accommodation cost is within the budget, and the dining option is also suitable.

- Day 2: The total activity duration exceeds 8 hours. The activities from 9:00 AM to 8:00 PM total 11 hours, which is not compliant with the daily activity duration requirement. Additionally, the lunch cost of $49 is on the higher side compared to other meals.
  - Suggestions for modification:
    1. Reduce the time spent at the Burpee Museum of Natural History to 1.5 hours (10:00-11:30) and adjust the lunch to a more budget-friendly option, perhaps around $30.
    2. Consider moving the visit to the Discovery Center Museum to a shorter duration or skipping it to keep the total activity duration under 8 hours.

- Day 3: The total activity duration exceeds 8 hours. The activities from 9:00 AM to 8:00 PM total 11 hours again, which is not compliant.
  - Suggestions for modification:
    1. Consider shortening visits to the Midway Village Museum and Tinker Swiss Cottage Museum to 1 hour each, allowing more time for lunch and reducing overall activity time.
    2. The dinner cost of $77 is quite high; consider a less expensive dining option to maintain budget flexibility.

Advice:
1. For Day 2, adjust the activities to ensure the total duration does not exceed 8 hours by reducing time spent at the Burpee Museum and considering a cheaper lunch option.
2. For Day 3, reduce the duration of museum visits and consider a less expensive dinner to keep the total daily activity duration within the limit and maintain budget flexibility.
